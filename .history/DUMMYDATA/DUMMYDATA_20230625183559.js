      "The NGSL 1.2 is a 2809-word list of the most important words of general English and daily life for second language learners. Though this is less than 10% of the vocabulary known by native speaker college graduates, it gives an average of 92% coverage of most texts of general English and even higher coverage in other situations (93% coverage for Harry Potter, 94% coverage for TOEIC exams, and 95% coverage for many TV shows such as Friends).",

    title: "The New Academic Word List",
    description:
      "The NAWL 1.2 is a 957 word list of the most important words for general academic English and designed to work in conjunction with the NGSL 1.2 and is an update and replacement for Averil Coxhead’s excellent Academic Word List (Coxhead, 2000). The replacement of the original AWL was needed since (1) the number of words in the NGSL is different than the number of words in the original GSL by West (1953), (2) word units in the NGSL Project are modified lexeme sets (or flemmas) rather than the word family approach used by the AWL and (3) we hoped to attain higher coverage than the list it replaces.",
