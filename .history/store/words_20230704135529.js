The replacement of the original AWL was needed since (1) the number of words in the NGSL is different than the number of words in the original GSL by West (1953), (2) word units in the NGSL Project are modified lexeme sets (or flemmas) rather than the word family approach used by the AWL and (3) we hoped to attain higher coverage than the list it replaces.",
